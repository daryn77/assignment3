Project: Online Caregivers Platform
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW
--------
This project implements a database system for an online caregivers platform that 
connects caregivers (babysitters, elderly care providers, playmates) with families 
seeking caregiving services. The system supports user registration, job postings, 
job applications, and appointment scheduling.


PART 1: DATABASE DESIGN (Completed)
------------------------------------
Successfully created and populated the physical database in PostgreSQL with all 
7 required tables:
  - USERS: Stores user account information (20 records)
  - CAREGIVER: Caregiver profiles with hourly rates (10 records)
  - MEMBER: Family member profiles seeking caregivers (10 records)
  - ADDRESS: Member address information (10 records)
  - JOB: Job postings by members (10 records)
  - JOB_APPLICATION: Applications from caregivers to jobs (10 records)
  - APPOINTMENT: Scheduled appointments between caregivers and members (10 records)

All primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships were properly defined.


PART 2: SQL QUERIES (Completed)
--------------------------------
Implemented all required SQL operations using Python 3 and SQLAlchemy:

  UPDATE Queries:
    - 3.1: Update phone number of Arman Armanov
    - 3.2: Add commission fee to caregivers (conditional update)

  DELETE Queries:
    - 4.1: Delete jobs posted by Amina Aminova (with cascade to job_applications)
    - 4.2: Delete members living on Kabanbay Batyr street (with cascade)

  Simple Queries (5.1-5.4):
    - Select caregiver and member names for accepted appointments
    - List jobs with 'soft-spoken' requirement
    - List work hours for babysitter positions
    - List members seeking Elderly Care in Astana with 'No pets.' rule

  Complex Queries (6.1-6.4):
    - Count applicants per job (multiple joins with aggregation)
    - Total hours by caregivers for accepted appointments
    - Average pay of caregivers based on accepted appointments
    - Caregivers earning above average (nested query with aggregation)

  Derived Attribute Query (7):
    - Calculate total cost per caregiver (hourly_rate × work_hours)

  View Operation (8):
    - Created and queried job_applications_view


PART 3: WEB APPLICATION (Completed)
------------------------------------
Developed a Flask web application with full CRUD functionality for all 7 tables:
  - Create: Add new records through web forms
  - Read: View all records in formatted tables
  - Update: Modify existing records
  - Delete: Remove records with confirmation

Features:
  - Modern, responsive user interface with left sidebar navigation
  - Form validation and error handling
  - Flash messages for user feedback
  - Foreign key constraint handling

Deployment:
  - Successfully deployed on Render.com
  - Live URL: [Insert your Render URL here]


CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS
-------------------------
1. Foreign Key Constraints: Resolved by implementing cascade deletes in proper order
2. Database Sync: Created migration script to transfer local data to production
3. Sequence Reset: Fixed auto-increment issues after data import


WHAT WAS NOT COMPLETED
-----------------------
All required components were successfully completed. No features were left unimplemented.


TECHNOLOGIES USED
------------------
  - Database: PostgreSQL
  - Backend: Python 3, SQLAlchemy, Flask
  - Frontend: HTML, CSS
  - Deployment: Render.com, Gunicorn
  - Version Control: Git, GitHub
