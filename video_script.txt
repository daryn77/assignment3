              VIDEO PRESENTATION SCRIPT - CSCI 341 Assignment 3
                    Online Caregivers Platform (10 minutes)
================================================================================

INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Hello, my name is [YOUR NAME]. This is my video presentation for CSCI 341 
Assignment 3. I have developed an Online Caregivers Platform that connects 
caregivers with families seeking caregiving services.

The project consists of three parts:
- Part 1: Database design in PostgreSQL
- Part 2: SQL queries using Python and SQLAlchemy  
- Part 3: A web application with CRUD operations

Let me walk you through each part."


================================================================================
PART 1: DATABASE DESIGN IN PGADMIN (3 minutes)
================================================================================

[OPEN PGADMIN AND SHOW YOUR DATABASE]

"For Part 1, I created the physical database in PostgreSQL using pgAdmin.

Let me show you the database structure."

[EXPAND YOUR DATABASE -> SCHEMAS -> TABLES]

"I have created 7 tables according to the given schema:

1. USERS table - stores basic user information like email, name, city, phone 
   number, and password. This is the parent table for both caregivers and members.

2. CAREGIVER table - stores caregiver-specific information like photo, gender, 
   caregiving type (babysitter, elderly care, or playmate), and hourly rate.
   The caregiver_user_id is a foreign key referencing the users table.

3. MEMBER table - stores member information including house rules and dependent 
   description. Members are families looking for caregivers.

4. ADDRESS table - stores the address of members with house number, street, 
   and town.

5. JOB table - stores job postings by members, including the required caregiving 
   type, other requirements, and date posted.

6. JOB_APPLICATION table - links caregivers to jobs they applied for, with the 
   date applied. This has a composite primary key.

7. APPOINTMENT table - stores appointment details including date, time, work 
   hours, and status (pending, accepted, or declined)."

[CLICK ON EACH TABLE AND SHOW THE DATA - RIGHT CLICK -> VIEW/EDIT DATA -> ALL ROWS]

"Let me show you the data in each table. I have inserted at least 10 records 
in each table as required.

[Show users table data]
Here are the users - we have 20 users with their contact information.

[Show caregiver table data]  
Here are 10 caregivers with different caregiving types and hourly rates.

[Show member table data]
Here are 10 members looking for caregivers.

[Show job table data]
Here are the job postings.

[Show appointment table data]
And here are the appointments with different statuses.

All foreign key relationships are properly defined, ensuring data integrity."


================================================================================
PART 2: SQL QUERIES IN PYTHON (4 minutes)
================================================================================

[OPEN main.py IN YOUR IDE OR SHOW THE FILE]

"For Part 2, I implemented all the required SQL queries using Python and 
SQLAlchemy. Let me show you the main.py file."

[SCROLL TO THE TOP OF THE FILE]

"First, I establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy's 
create_engine and sessionmaker."

[SCROLL TO UPDATE QUERIES SECTION]

"UPDATE QUERIES:

Query 3.1 updates the phone number of Arman Armanov to the specified number.

Query 3.2 adds a commission fee to caregivers - $0.30 if the hourly rate is 
less than $10, or 10% if it's $10 or more. This uses a CASE statement."

[SCROLL TO DELETE QUERIES SECTION]

"DELETE QUERIES:

Query 4.1 deletes all jobs posted by Amina Aminova. I first delete the related 
job applications to avoid foreign key violations, then delete the jobs.

Query 4.2 deletes all members living on Kabanbay Batyr street. This also 
handles cascading deletes for related records in job_application, job, 
appointment, and address tables."

[SCROLL TO SIMPLE QUERIES SECTION]

"SIMPLE QUERIES:

Query 5.1 selects caregiver and member names for accepted appointments using 
multiple JOINs.

Query 5.2 lists job IDs containing 'soft-spoken' in other requirements using 
the LIKE operator.

Query 5.3 lists work hours for all babysitter positions.

Query 5.4 lists members looking for Elderly Care in Astana with 'No pets.' rule."

[SCROLL TO COMPLEX QUERIES SECTION]

"COMPLEX QUERIES:

Query 6.1 counts the number of applicants for each job using multiple JOINs 
with GROUP BY.

Query 6.2 calculates total hours spent by caregivers for accepted appointments.

Query 6.3 calculates the average pay of caregivers based on accepted appointments.

Query 6.4 finds caregivers who earn above average using a nested subquery."

[SCROLL TO DERIVED ATTRIBUTE SECTION]

"Query 7 calculates the total cost per caregiver by multiplying hourly rate 
by work hours - this is the derived attribute."

[SCROLL TO VIEW SECTION]

"Query 8 creates a VIEW called job_applications_view that shows all job 
applications with applicant names and job details."

[RUN THE SCRIPT AND SHOW OUTPUT]

"Let me run the script to show you the results."

[Run: python main.py]

"As you can see, all queries execute successfully and return the expected results."


================================================================================
PART 3: WEB APPLICATION (2-3 minutes)
================================================================================

[OPEN YOUR BROWSER AND GO TO YOUR RENDER URL]

"For Part 3, I developed a Flask web application with full CRUD functionality 
for all 7 tables. The application is deployed on Render.com.

Let me show you the application."

[SHOW THE HOME PAGE]

"This is the home page with a navigation sidebar on the left. You can access 
all 7 tables from here."

[CLICK ON USERS]

"Let me demonstrate the CRUD operations using the Users table.

READ operation - Here you can see all users displayed in a table format with 
their ID, email, name, city, and phone number."

[CLICK CREATE NEW USER]

"CREATE operation - I can create a new user by filling out this form.
Let me add a test user..."

[Fill in the form and submit]

"The user is created successfully and appears in the list."

[CLICK UPDATE ON A USER]

"UPDATE operation - I can update any user's information. Let me modify this 
user's phone number..."

[Make a change and save]

"The update is saved successfully."

[CLICK DELETE ON A USER]

"DELETE operation - I can also delete users. There's a confirmation prompt 
to prevent accidental deletion."

[Show other tables briefly]

"The same CRUD functionality is available for all other tables:
- Caregivers
- Members  
- Addresses
- Jobs
- Job Applications
- Appointments

Each table has appropriate forms and validations."

[SHOW APPOINTMENTS OR JOBS TABLE]

"For example, in the Appointments table, you can see the caregiver name, 
member name, date, time, hours, and status. You can create new appointments, 
update existing ones, or delete them."


================================================================================
CONCLUSION (30 seconds)
================================================================================

"To summarize, I have successfully completed all three parts of the assignment:

- Part 1: Created the database with 7 tables and proper relationships
- Part 2: Implemented all required SQL queries in Python
- Part 3: Built and deployed a web application with full CRUD functionality

All components work together to create a functional Online Caregivers Platform.

Thank you for watching."

TIPS FOR RECORDING:
-------------------
1. Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
2. Have all applications open before recording (pgAdmin, IDE, browser)
3. Zoom in on code when showing specific queries
4. Keep the video under 10 minutes
5. Practice once before recording
6. Make sure your Render site is working before recording Part 3
